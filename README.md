Iâ€™ve built a Python + Streamlit project called "IPL BattleGround" that compares IPL batsmen vs bowlers using real match data (CSV). It includes stats like SR, Average, Wickets, 4s/6s, a pie chart, confidence meter, and verdict logic. Now, I want to convert this into a scalable full-stack web app with a professional UI.
