I’ve built a Python + Streamlit project called "IPL BattleGround" that compares IPL batsmen vs bowlers using real match data (CSV). It includes stats like SR, Average, Wickets, 4s/6s, a pie chart, confidence meter, and verdict logic. Now, I want to convert this into a scalable full-stack web app with a professional UI.

Help me break this project into phases and build it step-by-step using:
- ⚙️ FastAPI backend (for APIs, logic)
- 🎨 React or Next.js frontend (with charts, dropdowns)
- 🤖 Add an AI agent later (GPT-based explanations/predictions)
- 🧩 Possibly store user inputs or saved duels in DB (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
- 🌐 Deploy it on Vercel/Render with a custom domain later

I want guidance on everything — project setup, folder structure, best practices, hosting, and enhancements.

Let’s start building this from scratch as a real AI-powered IPL stats product.
